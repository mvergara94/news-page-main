![Design preview for the News homepage coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
- Challenge URL : [Link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl)
- Live Site URL: [Link](https://mvergara94.github.io/news-page-main/)

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's incredible to see how much you can do with only CSS e HTML, i worked a lot on this challenge on the menu animation for mobile. Mostly work with the mobile-first aproach and truly understand why is it better to do this way.
